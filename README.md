## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
Countdown timer for the Jetpack Compose #AndroidDevChallenge.
It has a simple design based on the system's countdown app.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
The Compose State CodeLab was super helpful to learn how to create this app.
It's interesting to see how the state can change based in something like a timer and to manage a conversion between input values different than sexagesimal time system.
